# watermarker
A program which takes Images and Gives a custom watermark of transparent red color.

Note: When you are done with watermarking photos and you close the program. You have to cut the photos from the images directory,
because if you restart your program and start marking other photos, they will overwrite the previous ones and take their place.

Thank You. :)
